# Reddit Client

A simple Reddit client where you can view, manage, and interact with subreddits.  
This project is based on the project idea from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/reddit-client).

## 🌐 Live Demo
Check out the live application here: [DEMO](https://reddit-client-one.vercel.app)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Reddit client allows users to:
- View a list of subreddits
- Add or delete custom subreddits
- Prevent deletion of default (protected) subreddits
- Show toast notifications for actions
- Handle subreddit management in a user-friendly way

## 🛠️ Features

- **Subreddit Management**: Add, browse, and (if allowed) delete subreddits.
- **Default Subreddit Protection**: Default popular subreddits (like `news`, `funny`, etc.) cannot be deleted.
- **Toast Notifications**: Friendly alerts for actions and restrictions.
- **Clean and Modern UI**: Easy to navigate and manage.

## 📋 Project Details

- **Frontend**: React (or whichever framework you're using)
- **State Management**: Local component state / Context API (adjust if using Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- **Notifications**: Toast system
- **Styling**: (Optional — TailwindCSS, Material UI, or your choice)

This project is inspired by the [Reddit Client Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/reddit-client) on roadmap.sh.
